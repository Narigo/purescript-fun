# purescript-fun

Trying out purescript for a bit and blogging about my impression and findings.

I've structured my observations into sessions as I'm trying to learn and build something with purescript. Right now, 
there are a few sessions available:

* [01-pure-purescript](./01-pure-purescript)
* [02-purescript-with-pulp](./02-purescript-with-pulp)
* [03-purescript-cli](./03-purescript-cli)
* [04-purescript-testing](./04-purescript-testing)
