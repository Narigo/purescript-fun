# 04 purescript testing

I like having tests and getting them from red to green. It gives me a sense of fulfillment (as I'm getting things done) 
and safety (as I can refactor the code later). From the first few examples I've seen and written myself, testing wasn't 
in the focus at all. Through understanding `map`, `bind`, etc. I hope I can begin and try to make tests and see how it 
works with such a type-safe language.

## The first test

After `pulp init`, we can call `pulp test` to start the tests. What can I say? It works out of the box, without changing
any configuration files.
