  "description": "Let's try to build something bigger than little functions. A small project using purescript only could make sense. From  the various examples, we can see that purescript can build / map / render HTML views quite easily. One of the challenges building bigger applications is quite often the performance. I want to build something with a lot of components and see  how it works out without re-rendering everything at all times. A (big) table might be a good challenge.",
